      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I am a first generation Polish-American living in Chicago. I currently live with my husband and our two
        kitties, Gracy and Grayson. Some of my interests outside of coding are baking/cooking new recipes, group workout
        classes, vegetable gardening, and taking care of my indoor plants.</p>
      <h2>Coding Journey:</h2>
      <p>At my first accounting job, we were a small team of three. My boss introduced me to SQL as we had to query our
        own reports. This is when I was first introduced to the world of coding. I had my daily accounting tasks, but
        also had time each week to have fun writing SQL queries and focus on improving our manual time-consuming tasks
        by building out new processes. I decided to move on from that job as I felt I wasn't growing in my accounting
        knowledge. Fast forward three years, my accounting knowledge grew the first year at my new job. But after that,
        the majority of my days at work were spent
        doing the same tasks month after month. I realized I was unhappy, I wasn't learning anymore. I made the decision
        to quit my job and join Fullstack Academy's Grace Hopper Program. For the last 17 weeks I've been immersed in
        web development and have been loving every second. </p>
      <h2>What I'd Love to Learn:</h2>
      <p>After many years of trying to improve my processes at work to get rid of redudent manual work, I would love to
        work on creating products that help improve the user experience(the user being a client of my company, or my
        company's internal departments). I really enjoy working on backend and frontend, slightly favoring backend over
        frontend. I really want to grow and furth my knowledge in all aspects of web development. I've learned so much
        during my bootcamp program, but there is still so much I don't know and can't wait learn! </p>
